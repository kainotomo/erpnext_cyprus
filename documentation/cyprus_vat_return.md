## Understanding the Cyprus VAT Return

The Cyprus VAT Return (Form VAT 4) is a mandatory tax filing that all VAT-registered businesses in Cyprus must submit. The return:

- Reports VAT collected on sales and services (output tax)
- Reports VAT paid on purchases and expenses (input tax)
- Calculates net VAT payable or refundable
- Reports values of domestic sales, exports, and acquisitions
- Includes special categories for EU transactions and reverse charge scenarios

VAT returns in Cyprus must typically be filed quarterly, though monthly filings may be required for businesses with high turnover or specific profiles.

## Company Configuration

Before using the Cyprus VAT Return report:

1. Configure your company settings:
   - Ensure your company's Tax ID is properly set up with the CY prefix
   - Set up default currency as EUR
   - Configure your fiscal year to match Cyprus tax calendar

2. VAT registration details:
   - Enter your VAT registration number correctly
   - Set up VAT filing frequency (monthly or quarterly)
   - Configure tax calculation settings to match Cyprus requirements (19% standard rate, 9% reduced rate, 5% reduced rate, and 0% for zero-rated supplies)

## Tax Account Setup

The ERPNext Cyprus app automatically configures the necessary tax accounts and templates for accurate VAT reporting:

1. **Tax Accounts**:
   - **VAT Account**: Used for both input and output VAT transactions
   - **OSS VAT Account**: Specifically for Mini One Stop Shop reporting for B2C digital services to EU consumers

2. **Tax Templates**:
   - **Purchase Tax Templates**:
     - **Reverse Charge**: Double-entry template with 19% VAT for EU acquisitions (adds and deducts VAT in the same transaction)
     - **Standard Domestic**: For local purchases with 19% VAT
     - **Zero-Rated**: For exempt purchases or imports

   - **Sales Tax Templates**:
     - **Standard Domestic**: For local sales with 19% VAT
     - **Zero-Rated**: For EU B2B sales and exports
     - **Out-of-Scope**: For transactions outside the VAT system
     - **OSS Digital Services templates**: Country-specific templates for each EU member state with appropriate VAT rates

3. **Item Tax Templates**:
   - **Cyprus Standard 19%**: For standard-rated goods and services
   - **Cyprus Reduced 9%**: For reduced-rate items (e.g., restaurant services)
   - **Cyprus Super Reduced 5%**: For super reduced-rate items (e.g., books, medicines)
   - **Zero Rated**: For zero-rated supplies
   - **Exempt**: For exempt supplies

4. **Tax Rules**:
   The system automatically applies the correct tax template based on:
   - Customer/supplier country
   - Whether the transaction is B2B or B2C
   - Type of goods/services

5. **Service Items**:
   - Any product that is not a tangible product should be marked as "Is Service" in order
   
   These field determine how transactions are reported in boxes 8A/8B (supply of goods vs services) and 11A/11B (acquisition of goods vs services) of the VAT return.

## Transaction Configuration

For accurate VAT reporting, ensure your transactions are properly categorized:

1. Sales Invoices:
   - Apply the correct tax template based on the nature of the sale
   - For EU B2B sales, use zero-rated templates and include customer VAT numbers
   - For exports outside the EU, use zero-rated export templates
   - For local sales, use the appropriate VAT rate template

2. Purchase Invoices:
   - Apply the correct tax template based on the nature of the purchase
   - For EU acquisitions, use reverse charge templates
   - For local purchases, use standard VAT templates
   - For imports from outside the EU, correctly record import VAT

3. Item Configuration:
   - Mark items as goods or services using the "Is Service" field
   - This distinction is critical for EU reporting (Boxes 8A/8B and 11A/11B)

4. Customer/Supplier Configuration:
   - Properly record country and tax ID information
   - For EU businesses, ensure the tax ID includes the correct country prefix
